# <Prework-study-guide>

## Description

This webpage was created in order to help bootcamp students study topics covered in their assigned pre-work. It provides notes on four different pre-work topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Creating this page introduced me to basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, and git languages, and it allowed me to see the structure of a basic webpage.

## Installation

## Usage

Pre-work students can find notes on various pre-work topics, and, by opening DevTools in chrome, they can use JavaScript features. In the console, the four study topics are listed, and one is selected at random to study.
